This script was pretty recent, I made this for a server that requested a script for players to run "Brinks missions" or Fleeca in game. Essentially, the player needs a certain key to access a terminal. When that terminal is accessed they have the ability to invite other players to their mission or run it solo. The terminal pulls from the database to update player statistics gained from the job real-time.

When they hit start in the terminal, they are given a configurable amount of places to go and drop off the money bags, if they fail due to time or the truck is destroyed--the mission ends. 

This script uses state-bags to store player state on the server, and is read by the client. All events are secure and is hard to exploit via script kiddies that use shitty LUA menus.
