# Description
This is my current project! 

I am working on a full server base written fully in typescript! 

If you take a look at the modules, you can see how the players are handled when they join the server via `PlayerManager` object! When they join, identifiers are grabbed/verified, then updated into the database!

When they leave the server, the index tied to their netID is deleted to clean up.
