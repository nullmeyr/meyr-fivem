# NoPixel Developer Proposal

## Small introduction of me
I go by Meyr, and I'm currently 19 and in University--I've been developing and writing code in the Cfx.re environment for around 6 years now (yes, I was very young when I started) I'm still fired up every day about making something new! 

## Repository Description
I have made this repository and compiled some of my works to be showcased! Everything you see in this repository is **100%** written by myself. Some of the resource names are different because they were written for different projects.
