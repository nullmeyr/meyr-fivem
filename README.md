# NoPixel Developer Proposal

## Small introduction of me
I go by Meyr, and I'm currently 19 and in University--I've been developing and writing code in the Cfx.re environment for around 6 years now (yes, I was very young when I started) I'm still fired up every day about making something new! I've always wanted to be apart of something massive in FiveM and take my skillset to the next level!

## Repository Description
I have made this repository and compiled some of my works to be showcased! Everything you see in this repository is **100%** written by myself. Some of the resource names are different because they were written for different projects. 

If you have any questions about anything at all, please reach out to me and I can explain (whether it is my thought process behind something or something else).
